    "## First steps with the gym interface\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have noticed in the previous notebooks, an environment that follows the gym interface is quite simple to use.\n",
    "It provides to this user mainly three methods, which have the following signature (for gym versions > 0.26)\n",
    "- `reset()` called at the beginning of an episode, it returns an observation and a dictionary with additional info (defaults to an empty dict)\n",
    "- `step(action)` called to take an action with the environment, it returns the next observation, the immediate reward, whether new state is a terminal state (episode is finished), whether the max number of timesteps is reached (episode is artificially finished), and additional information\n",
    "- (Optional) `render()` which allow to visualize the agent in action. Note that graphical interface does not work on google colab, so we cannot use it directly (we have to rely on `render_mode='rbg_array'` to retrieve an image of the scene).\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, it also contains two useful properties:\n",
    "- `observation_space` which one of the gym spaces (`Discrete`, `Box`, ...) and describe the type and shape of the observation\n",
    "- `action_space` which is also a gym space object that describes the action space, so the type of action that can be taken\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to learn about [gym spaces](https://gymnasium.farama.org/api/spaces/) is to look at the [source code](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/tree/main/gymnasium/spaces), but you need to know at least the main ones:\n",
    "- `gym.spaces.Box`: A (possibly unbounded) box in $R^n$. Specifically, a Box represents the Cartesian product of n closed intervals. Each interval has the form of one of [a, b], (-oo, b], [a, oo), or (-oo, oo). Example: A 1D-Vector or an image observation can be described with the Box space.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example for using image as input:\n",
    "observation_space = spaces.Box(low=0, high=255, shape=(HEIGHT, WIDTH, N_CHANNELS), dtype=np.uint8)\n",
    "```                                       \n",
    "\n",
    "- `gym.spaces.Discrete`: A discrete space in $\\{ 0, 1, \\dots, n-1 \\}$\n",
    "  Example: if you have two actions (\"left\" and \"right\") you can represent your action space using `Discrete(2)`, the first action will be 0 and the second 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Documentation on custom env](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/custom_env.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also keep in mind that Stabe-baselines internally uses the previous gym API (<0.26), so every VecEnv returns only the observation after resetting and returns a 4-tuple instead of a 5-tuple  (terminated & truncated are already combined to done)."
